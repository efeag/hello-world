My name is Eferhire Aganbi-Okome. I'm currently training with Per Scholas to earn my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. This training has provided so far, exposure to core AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, Programming in Python, Shell scripting, and more. I intend to take the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam before November 26, 2025.
